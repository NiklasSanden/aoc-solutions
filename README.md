## 2021
In an attempt to learn more about the algorithms and ranges libraries in C++20, the solutions for 2021 are remade using as much of their functionality that I could think of.

Although optimization is far from the focus of these solutions, here are the execution times from one run:
```
Day 01 Part 1
